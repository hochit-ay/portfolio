# Ho Chit Au-Yeung (Dorothy) - Graphic Design & Bespoke Art Portfolio

## 1. Process, challenges I faced during development:
As I was not familiar with Bootstrap, I struggled a lot at first.
Making the layout responsive is the most difficult part for me because I had to reorder the elements in the page.
Styling the elements was also hard. I had to use both bootstrap class and css, sometimes I wasn't sure which to use.
But after I successfully built the homepage, other pages became easier.


## 2. How I overcame those challenges:
Lukily, I can always search the answers on google and youtube.
I made use of the resources available online and solved the problems.


## 3. What have I learned by creating my web portfolio:
After finishing the assignment, I am more confident with using Bootstrap and other css libraries, which is very helpful and saves a lot of time.
And structuring the html well is very important. It helped me fix the problems easier when I had to back track my code.
I also had fun adding animation to my graphics.
